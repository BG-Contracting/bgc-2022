<h3>All Contracts</h3>

<p>All contracts and instructions are accepted on the basis of full payment within 7 days of the date of the invoice. Non payment within 7 days may result in referral of invoices to debt collection. The authorised signatory accepts that all costs relating to debt collection are paid by them in addition to the BG Contracting invoiced amount.

    </p>
<h3>Tree Preservation Orders and Conservation Areas</h3>

<p>The trees concerned in the contract may be in a Conservation Area or be protected by a District Plan. Responsibility for all permission obtained from relevant authority will remain the responsibility of the authorised signatory or owner unless BG Contracting is requested to do so in this contract.
    </p>
<h3>Private Covenants and Boundaries</h3>

<p>Investigation of Private Covenants and Boundaries shall be the responsibility of the authorised signatory or owner and no liability shall attach to the Contractor for a breach of any such Covenant or Boundary.
    </p>
<h3>Underground Services</h3>

<p>Unless a plan showing the exact location of underground pipes, wires or cables is provided to BG Contracting by the authorised signatory or owner of the land (or their agent) prior to the formation of the contract, the contractor shall be under no liability for any damage caused as a result of work performed under the contract to such pipes, wires or cables, or for any damage to property resulting therefrom and the owner of the land or his agent shall be solely liable for any such damage. In the case of damage to any services not shown on plans given to the Contractor, the Contractor will maintain no liability.

    </p>
<h3>Completion of Contract</h3>

Further, we retain the right in such circumstances to cancel the contract in whole or in part. Completion dates shall be contingent upon weather conditions.
    </p>
<h3>Expiry of Quotation or Estimate
    </h3>
<p>After 30 days from the date of quotation, the contractor reserves the right to withdraw and reprice work unless otherwise agreed in writing.
    </p>
<h3>Hidden Obstructions</h3>

<p>Quotations or estimates for felling are based on the assumption of trees being free from metal, stone or other hidden obstructions. In the event of a tree being impossible to fell in the quoted way using standard techniques, the company reserves the right to requote accordingly.
    </p>
<h3>Stump Grinding</h3>

<p>Stump grinding involves the removal of the tree stump to a depth of 150mm, but does not include the removal of lateral root or stump chippings unless specified otherwise.,
    </p>
<h3>Site Conditions</h3>

<p>The contract price is based on the site conditions existing at the time of the preparation of the quote/estimate remaining unchanged.
    </p>
<h3>Duration</h3>
